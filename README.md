Arc Virtual Cell Atlas
======================

The Arc Virtual Cell Atlas is a collection of high quality, curated, open source datasets assembled for the purpose of accelerating the creation of virtual cell models.
The atlas includes both observational and perturbational data from over 300 million cells (and growing).

The atlas is bootstrapped with [Vevo’s](https://www.vevo.ai/) Tahoe-100M and [Arc’s](https://arcinstitute.org/) AI-curated scBaseCamp dataset.
